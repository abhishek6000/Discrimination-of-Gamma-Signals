# Statistical Discrimination of Primary Gammas Signals 

Identification of Gamma signals based on a Monte-Carlo generated dataset to simulate registration of high energy Gamma particles in a ground based atmospheric Cherenkov Gamma telescope using the imaging technique. Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherekov Telescopes(MAGIC) is a system of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes which detects particle showers released by Gamma rays, using the Cherenkov radiation. While other ground based gamma-ray telescopes typically absorb Gamma energies above 200-300GeV, MAGIC is sensitive to rays with photon energies between 25GeV and 50TeV.

We experimented upon several approaches. Decision tree was used as one of the classifying algorithms. To avoid over-fitting, we fixed the maximum depth to 10 and the maximum number of leaf nodes to 200. An accuracy of 84.9% was obtained. Support Vector Machines clocked an accuracy of 66.46%. Multi Layered Perceptrons were also used for experimentation. A number of models were used for training from scratch, with accuracy peaking at 85.02% on a 4-layer deep model using Adamax as the optimizer. The final metric used was area under ROC curve, since classifying a background event as signal is worse than the opposite. 0.85 was obtained for the decision tree model and 0.83 on the SVM.
